    <h2>Community selected talks</h2>
    <p>
        Call for Papers <strong>runs until 1st February 2019</strong> after which the process of reviewing and selecting talks begins. Organizers will form a selection committee that will study each and every proposal and after three rounds of voting they will made the selection according to the quality of the proposal as well as to the interest from the targeted audience. The whole process takes no more than a month and the final list of speakers and their talks will be announced by begging of March, 2019.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>For the first time ever, we would like to include all conference participants in this process</strong> - the Call for Papers is public, meaning that all registered users will have access to the list of proposals and will be able to vote for their favorite talks and comment them. This approach allows us to pick subjects that are most attractive for the community. You have the opportunity to help our team in selecting talks for {{ site.title }}.

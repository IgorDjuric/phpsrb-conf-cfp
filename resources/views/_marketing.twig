        The Call for Papers will be open until February 1, 2019. After that, we will begin the review and selection
        process. Organizers will form a selection committee that will study each and every proposal. After three rounds
        of voting, the decision will be made according to the quality of proposals and to the interest from the targeted
        audience. The whole process takes no more than a month and the final list of speakers and their talks will be
        announced by the beginning of March 2019.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the first time ever, we would like to include all conference participants in this process - the Call for
        Papers is public, meaning that all registered users will have access to the list of proposals and will be able
        to vote for their favorite talks and comment them. This approach allows us to pick subjects that are most
        attractive for the community. You have the opportunity to help our team in selecting talks for PHP Serbia
        Conference 2019.

    <h2>Diversity Matters!</h2>
    <p>
        {{ site.title }} is committed to creating a conference that is as inclusive as possible. We want to showcase
        talent available around the world and welcome international submissions as well.

        We are also committed to ensuring the conference is a place where ideas are exchanged, old friends get together,
        new friends meet and <strong>harassment is not tolerated</strong>. We expect speakers, attendees and sponsor
        representatives to be professional and courteous to each other. We reserve the right to remove, without refund,
        ANY attendee (speaker or otherwise) who is unable to adhere to this policy.

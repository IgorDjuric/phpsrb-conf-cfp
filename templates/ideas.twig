    <h2 class="headline--beta">Talk Ideas</h2>
    <p>
        It should be noted that we donâ€™t necessarily look for just PHP-related talks. It would also desirable for us to have sessions on some related technologies, too.
    </p>
    <p>
        Due to financial constraints, most conferences tend to pick speakers to present multiple talks. Therefore it is advisable to submit a few talk ideas, not just one.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Talk duration:</strong> 50 minutes + 10 minutes for questions</p>
    <p>
